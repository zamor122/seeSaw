I used two semaphores. One controlling the up motion and the other controlling the down motion of each person. The up semaphore for Fred begins the program and calls the down Semaphore for the decreasing height action for the opposite person. I used this method because the up semaphore calls the down semaphore for the other person after the other person has already gone. For instance, Fred starts at height 1. Fred pushes and goes up Fred's velocity of 1 and then the semaphore releases and calls the down semaphore. The down semaphore acquires and performs the Wilma down action at freds velocity and goes until Fred hits height 7 and Wilma hits height 1. Then Wilma pushes off the ground and the same thing occurs in the opposite way.
